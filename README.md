## Introduction
Data Analyzer is a powerful and user-friendly web application designed to simplify data analysis. With features like EDA, data cleaning, and visualization, it transforms raw data into actionable insights. 
The idea for Data Analyzer stemmed from my experiences with cumbersome data analysis tools. Growing up in a data-driven environment, I found many tools either too complex or too limited. I wanted to create something that balanced functionality with user-friendliness. One of the biggest technical challenges was ensuring smooth interaction between React and Firebase, especially for real-time updates and data storage. This project taught me valuable lessons in API integration and UI/UX design
